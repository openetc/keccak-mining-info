# ECBP-01 Best Practices and Software that Implements ECIP-1049.
Best Practices for Ethereum Classic Keccak-256 Mining. All practcies here comply with the ECIP-1049 standard and activate at Block 13,500,000. Estimated to be 9 Months from the date of acceptance.

Every resource on this page is maintained by volunteers and companies, and is added to the page or removed based on whether we recogonize it as complying with the protocl. All management of this is handled through Github Issues.

## Full Node Software

Listed below are major nodes implementations in the ecosystem of the Ethereum Standard. We invite all entities to develop support for the network, and will add or remove to the list based on Github issues:

Because of the weight of the Ethash algorithm, we encourage users concerned with performance and maintaibility to consider Lite Node support, which verifies only Keccak256 proof of work. 

Full Node Support: Able to verify from genesis the Ethereum Classic network proof of work, both Ethash and Keccak-256.
Lite Node Support: Able to verify the Ethereum Classic network proof after implementation, post block 13,500,000, only Keccak-256.
